# Media Key Disabler

A simple tray tool to globally hook and cancel the Media keyboard keys.

Written because the SteelSeries Arctis 5 headset doesn't provide a mechanism to disable the power button acting as a media key.
I'm often intending to turn my headset off, only to find I didn't press the button long enough and instead it started playing music.
With this, if I don't press it long enough, it at least will time out due to inactivity instead of playing music all night.
